  <p class="description">
    A riff on 'monteiths summer ale' brewed in Greymouth, NZ. As is typical with
    a NZ 'ale', a Pilsner malt base is used. This is supplemented with taiheke
    hops, fresh ginger, orange peel and rata honey (Rata is known as the New
    Zealand Christmas tree). This creates a crystal clear, summer beer - perfect
    for a beer or 2 out in the sunshine.
